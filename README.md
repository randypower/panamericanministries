# StackMob Javascript Examples

Welcome!  You're here because you downloaded the JS SDK Starter zip or you've forked/cloned the <a href="https://github.com/stackmob/stackmob-javascript-examples" target="_blank">JS Examples GitHub repo</a>.

Here are several examples utilizing the JS SDK.  Feel free to use the code as you wish - copy, reuse.. recycle?  

There are demos and examples for your reference.

Do you need a GitHub project to try <a href="http://www.stackmob.com/devcenter/docs/StackMob-Hosted-HTML5:-GitHub" target="_blank">StackMob hosting</a>?  Feel free to use this one by forking it to your GitHub account!

You can find the `stackmob-javascript-examples` repo at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stackmob/stackmob-javascript-examples">https://github.com/stackmob/stackmob-javascript-examples</a>   

# Contents

The root folder has `index.html` which will get you started right away!

Included are examples housed in each respective folder.   

# Running the Examples 


You'll need to initialize `StackMob.init({ ... })` with your application's information.  Some of these examples also need specific schemas and relationships set up.  These will be described in the example pages and respective READMEs.

First, <a href="https://stackmob.com/platform/help/tutorials/html5_js_sdk" target="_blank">Setup your JS SDK and your StackMob Local Runner</a>.

Save your `.stackmob` file to the folder.  For instance, if you see:

		/mycomputer/JS Starter 0.5.0/index.html
		
Then save your `.stackmob` file into:

		/mycomputer/JS Starter 0.5.0/.stackmob
		
You should then run StackMob Local Runner from the root folder.  In your terminal/command prompt, run:

		>  stackmob server
   
		
Once Local Runner is running, feel free to start exploring by visiting these pages!
